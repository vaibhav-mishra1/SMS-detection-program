# SMS Spam Detection System Using NLP

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Overview
The SMS Spam Detection System Using NLP is designed to automatically classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system preprocesses the text, extracts relevant features, and applies machine learning models to accurately detect spam messages.

## Features
- Preprocessing of SMS messages (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming)
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorization
- Machine learning models for spam classification (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

## Web Deployment
The model was deployed on the web using Streamlit. The user interface has a simple input box where the user can input a message, and the model will predict whether it is spam or not spam.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLP Libraries (NLTK)
- Machine Learning Libraries (scikit-learn)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Word Cloud
- Streamlit
## Installation

- Clone the repository:
git clone

```bash
  https://github.com/vaibhav-mishra1/SMS-detection-program.git
```
- Install the required Python packages using
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt.
```
## Usage
To use the SMS Spam Detection model on your own machine,
- Run the model using
```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```
- Visit localhost:8501 on your web browser to access the web app.
